This app is photo sharing social media app that lets you share photos with other users in your area! Photos can then
be voted to the top of the photofeed and commented on as well.

The front-end is built using swift.

For the back-end I used the Django Rest Framework to build my own api that takes care of users/comments/uploads/voting/etc. 

Since the servers are in production I have uploaded demo gifs below! 

Some plans for future features are:
- adding text/drawing to uploaded photos
- ~~adding videos~~   Videos Added!
- ~~adding gesture controls instead of buttons~~ Done! (possible changes to be made still)

Thanks for checking out my project! 

*Gifs are out of date have redisgined the photo button and a few other changes!

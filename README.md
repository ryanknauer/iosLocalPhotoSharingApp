This app is photo sharing social media app that lets you share photos with other users in your area! Photos can then be voted to the top of the photofeed and commented on as well.

The front-end is built using swift.

For the back-end I used the Django Rest Framework to build my own api that takes care of users/comments/uploads/voting/etc.

Since the servers are in production I have uploaded pictures and a demo video below!

Some plans for future features are:

adding text/drawing to uploaded photos
adding videos
adding gesture controls instead of buttons
Thanks for checking out my project!
